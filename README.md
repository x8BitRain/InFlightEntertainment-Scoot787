# InFlightEntertainment-Scoot787
Some of the javascript frontend and website files from Scoot Airline's 787 Dreamliner browser based IFE system, mostly for archival purposes.

I was also interested in how far IFEs have come in terms of security so I have uploaded an 'intense' NMAP scan for the airborne server itself. Very secure by the looks of things!
